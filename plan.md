# Resume Optimization Evaluation Framework - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Build a systematic evaluation framework for improving resume optimization prompts using PydanticAI's evaluation patterns. The framework will provide automated testing, prompt refinement, and continuous improvement capabilities.

- PydanticAI integration
- Updated dependencies in pyproject.toml

**Implementation Prompt:**
```text
Set up the evaluation framework project structure for the resume optimization system. Create a new directory `evaluation/` in the project root with subdirectories for test data, evaluators, and results. Install PydanticAI and required dependencies. Update pyproject.toml to include pydantic-ai, pytest-asyncio, and any evaluation-specific dependencies. Create __init__.py files and basic module structure following Python best practices.
```

Create an EvaluationResult model to store evaluation outcomes with scores, timestamps, and detailed metrics. Include methods for JSON serialization and validation. Follow the existing codebase patterns and ensure compatibility with PydanticAI's Dataset structure.
```

### Step 1.3: Sample Test Dataset Creation
**Goal**: Create a small, manually curated test dataset

- Manual ground truth annotations
- YAML/JSON test data files

**Implementation Prompt:**
```text
Create a curated test dataset with 10-15 diverse resume and job description pairs. Include a mix of technical roles (software engineering, DevOps), experience levels (junior to senior), and match qualities (perfect matches, clear mismatches, edge cases). Manually annotate each pair with expected match scores and key skills. Store the data in YAML format for easy editing and version control. Include metadata about the test case purpose and expected behavior.
```

## Phase 2: Core Evaluation Components (Weeks 3-4)

Integrate with PydanticAI's Dataset and Case structures. Include proper error handling, logging, and progress tracking. Ensure the system can handle both sync and async evaluation methods.
```

### Step 2.2: Accuracy Evaluator for Job Parsing
**Goal**: Implement evaluation for `parse_job_requirements()` method using LLMJudge

Design a comprehensive evaluation rubric that assesses: skill extraction completeness, technology identification accuracy, requirement prioritization correctness, and confidence score calibration. Configure LLMJudge to use Sonnet as the judge model. The rubric should handle fuzzy matching for similar skills (e.g., "JavaScript" vs "JS") and provide detailed feedback on parsing quality. Include scoring criteria for handling edge cases and ambiguous job descriptions. Return structured evaluation results with specific improvement recommendations.
```

### Step 2.3: Match Score Evaluator

Configure LLMJudge with Sonnet to provide nuanced assessment of scoring rationale. The rubric should evaluate whether the model properly identifies both strong matches and red flags. Include criteria for assessing score calibration and distribution across different match quality levels.
```

## Phase 3: Optimization Quality Assessment (Weeks 5-6)

Design a strict evaluation rubric that identifies: fabricated experiences or skills, inflated metrics or achievements, misleading rephrasing, and unsupported claims. Configure LLMJudge with Sonnet to carefully compare original and optimized content. The rubric should distinguish between acceptable enhancements (rephrasing, reorganizing, highlighting) and unacceptable modifications (adding unverified information, exaggerating accomplishments). Include severity levels for different types of truthfulness violations and provide specific examples of what was changed and why it's problematic.
```

### Step 3.2: Content Quality Evaluator

Implement a ContentQualityEvaluator using PydanticAI's LLMJudge to assess the professional quality of optimized resume content. Create an evaluation rubric that measures: clarity and conciseness of writing, professional tone and language, ATS compatibility (keyword usage, formatting), impact and quantification of achievements, and consistency in style and terminology. Configure LLMJudge with Sonnet to evaluate whether content meets professional resume standards. The rubric should identify issues like buzzword overuse, vague descriptions, passive voice, and missing quantification. Provide specific suggestions for quality improvements.
```

### Step 3.3: Relevance Impact Evaluator
**Goal**: Measure actual improvement from optimizations using LLMJudge
**Duration**: 1.5 days (reduced due to LLMJudge simplification)
**Deliverables**:

```text
Create a RelevanceImpactEvaluator using PydanticAI's LLMJudge to measure the effectiveness of resume optimizations. Design an evaluation rubric that assesses: improvement in job-resume alignment, enhancement of relevant skills visibility, better targeting of key requirements, and overall impact on match potential. Configure LLMJudge with Sonnet to compare before/after versions and identify which changes had the most positive impact. The rubric should evaluate whether optimizations successfully highlight transferable skills, improve keyword alignment, and enhance the candidate's fit for the role. Provide specific feedback on which optimizations were most effective and which areas still need improvement.
```
