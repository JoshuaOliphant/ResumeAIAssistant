# Enhanced Parallel Processing Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for an enhanced parallel processing architecture for resume customization. The design builds on the existing implementation while addressing performance bottlenecks and adding new capabilities.

## Current Architecture Assessment

The current parallel processing architecture provides:
1. Section-based parallelization of resume processing
2. Task scheduling with priorities
3. Basic error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. Results aggregation

Areas for improvement:
1. Task batching is limited
2. No dynamic adjustment of task priorities based on content complexity
3. Limited optimization of model selection for different sections
4. No circuit breaker pattern for handling API failures
5. No sequential final pass to ensure consistency across sections
6. Lack of caching for repetitive tasks

## Enhanced Architecture Design

### 1. Advanced Task Scheduler

Enhance the `ParallelTaskScheduler` to:
- Implement dynamic priority adjustment based on task importance and processing history
- Add batch processing of similar tasks to reduce API overhead
- Introduce work-stealing approach to balance load when some tasks finish early
- Implement a circuit breaker pattern to handle API rate limiting and failures

```python
class EnhancedTaskScheduler(ParallelTaskScheduler):
    """Enhanced scheduler with batch processing and dynamic priorities."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent_tasks: int = MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS):
        super().__init__(max_concurrent_tasks)
        self.circuit_breakers = {}  # Track API provider circuit states
        self.performance_metrics = {}  # Track performance metrics by task type
    
    async def batch_tasks(self, tasks: List[ParallelTask]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Batch similar tasks together for efficient processing."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def adjust_priorities(self):
        """Dynamically adjust task priorities based on waiting time and importance."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    async def execute_with_circuit_breaker(self, task: ParallelTask) -> Any:
        """Execute a task with circuit breaker pattern for API failure handling."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Model Selection Optimization

Enhance model selection based on:
- Historical performance data for different section types
- Content complexity metrics 
- Cost vs. performance tradeoffs
- Deadline sensitivity

```python
class ModelSelectionOptimizer:
    """Optimizes model selection for different tasks based on multiple factors."""
    
    def select_model_for_section(
        self, 
        section_type: SectionType, 
        content: str, 
        task_type: str,
        deadline_sensitivity: float = 1.0
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Select the optimal model for a specific section and task.
        
        Args:
            section_type: Type of resume section
            content: Section content
            task_type: Type of task (evaluation, optimization, etc.)
            deadline_sensitivity: How important is quick processing (0.0-2.0)
            
        Returns:
            Model configuration dictionary
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Enhanced Sectioning Algorithm

Improve the resume segmentation for more granular parallel processing:

```python
class EnhancedResumeSegmenter(ResumeSegmenter):
    """Enhanced resume segmenter with more granular section detection."""
    
    @staticmethod
    def identify_subsections(section_content: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """
        Further break down large sections into logical subsections.
        
        Args:
            section_content: Content of a section
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary mapping subsection names to their content
        """
        # Implementation details...
    
    @staticmethod
    def identify_sections_with_ml(resume_content: str) -> Dict[SectionType, str]:
        """
        Use ML techniques to more accurately identify sections.
        
        Args:
            resume_content: The full resume content
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary mapping section types to their content
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 4. Sequential Final Pass

Add a sequential consistency pass to ensure coherent results across sections:

```python
class SequentialConsistencyPass:
    """Ensures consistency across independently processed sections."""
    
    async def process(
        self,
        sections: Dict[SectionType, str],
        optimization_results: Dict[SectionType, Dict[str, Any]],
        job_description: str
    ) -> Dict[SectionType, str]:
        """
        Process all sections sequentially to ensure consistency.
        
        Args:
            sections: Original section content
            optimization_results: Results from parallel optimization
            job_description: Job description text
            
        Returns:
            Dictionary mapping section types to consistent optimized content
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

### 5. Caching Layer

Implement caching to avoid redundant processing:

```python
class ProcessingCache:
    """Cache for storing intermediate processing results."""
    
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 100, ttl_seconds: int = 3600):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.ttl_seconds = ttl_seconds
    
    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        """Get a value from the cache if it exists and is not expired."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
        """Store a value in the cache with current timestamp."""
        # Implementation details...
    
    def generate_key(self, section_type: SectionType, content: str, task: str) -> str:
        """Generate a unique cache key based on content hash and metadata."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 6. Enhanced Error Recovery

Improve error recovery with more sophisticated retry and fallback strategies:

```python
class ErrorRecoveryManager:
    """Manages error recovery strategies for different types of failures."""
    
    async def recover_from_api_error(
        self, 
        error: Exception, 
        task: ParallelTask,
        retry_count: int
    ) -> Optional[Any]:
        """
        Attempt to recover from API errors with appropriate strategies.
        
        Args:
            error: The exception that occurred
            task: The task that failed
            retry_count: Number of retries already attempted
            
        Returns:
            Result if recovery successful, None otherwise
        """
        # Implementation details...
    
    async def recover_with_simpler_model(
        self,
        task: ParallelTask
    ) -> Optional[Any]:
        """
        Recover by retrying the task with a simpler model.
        
        Args:
            task: The task that failed
            
        Returns:
            Result if recovery successful, None otherwise
        """
        # Implementation details...
```

## Workflow

The enhanced parallel processing workflow will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Processing**:
   - Resume is broken into sections and subsections for more granular processing
   - Complexity metrics calculated for each section

2. **Task Creation & Prioritization**:
   - Create tasks for each section/subsection
   - Assign initial priorities based on section importance and complexity
   - Group similar tasks for potential batching

3. **Execution**:
   - Execute tasks in parallel with enhanced scheduler
   - Use circuit breaker pattern to handle API failures
   - Dynamically adjust priorities based on progress
   - Apply caching to avoid redundant processing

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Enhanced error recovery with provider-specific strategies
   - Fallback to simpler models or alternative providers
   - Partial results capture for sections that can't be fully processed

5. **Results Aggregation**:
   - Aggregate results as before, with enhanced weighting
   - Apply sequential consistency pass to ensure coherent results

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Capture performance metrics for future optimization
   - Update model selection preferences based on outcomes

## Implementation Plan

1. Create enhanced task scheduler with batching and circuit breaker
2. Implement model selection optimization logic
3. Enhance resume segmentation for more granular processing
4. Add sequential consistency pass
5. Implement caching layer
6. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
7. Update tests to verify improvements

## Expected Performance Improvements

- Processing time reduction: 50-70% compared to current implementation
- API cost reduction: 20-30% through optimized model selection
- Error rate reduction: 70-80% through better recovery mechanisms
- More consistent results across resume sections

## Monitoring and Telemetry

The enhanced architecture will include:
- Detailed timing metrics for each processing step
- Success/failure rates by provider and model
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Optimization suggestions based on usage patterns
