| #10 | Enhance Security and Compliance Features | Medium | Backend, Infrastructure |
| #11 | Enhance Results Visualization and User Flow | Medium | Frontend, UX |

## Parallel Work Streams

The issues can be grouped into parallel work streams by role/expertise:

### Frontend Specialists
These issues focus on UI/UX improvements and can be worked on independently from backend changes:
- **#3: Implement Improved Diff Visualization** - Enhance the way resume changes are displayed
- **#4: Develop Interactive Resume Review and Editing Interface** - Create interactive editing capabilities
- **#11: Enhance Results Visualization and User Flow** - Improve overall UX and visualization

### Backend Specialists
These issues focus on core backend functionality and can be worked on independently:
- **#1: Implement Parallel Processing Architecture** - Improve processing speed through parallelization
- **#6: Enhance Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern** - Improve the AI customization workflow
- **#8: Implement Model Optimization** - Create tiered model selection for cost efficiency
- **#9: Implement Caching and Optimization** - Add caching for improved performance
- **#10: Enhance Security and Compliance** - Improve security features

### Full-Stack Developers
These issues require both frontend and backend expertise:
- **#2: Enhance Progress Tracking System** - Real-time progress updates require frontend and backend changes
- **#7: Implement Feature Flag System** - Requires changes across the stack

### AI/Infrastructure Specialists
These issues focus on AI implementation and infrastructure:
- **#5: Implement Claude Code Proof of Concept** - Requires AI and infrastructure expertise
- **#8: Implement Model Optimization** - Requires AI expertise

## Dependencies and Critical Path

Some issues have dependencies that should be considered when planning parallel work:

1. **Critical Path Issues** (should be prioritized):
   - #1: Parallel Processing Architecture - Enables multiple performance improvements
   - #5: Claude Code Proof of Concept - Key architectural decision point

2. **Dependency Relationships**:
   - #4 (Interactive Resume Review) depends on #3 (Improved Diff Visualization)
   - Parts of #2 (Progress Tracking) will integrate with #1 (Parallel Processing)
   - #9 (Caching) will eventually integrate with #1 (Parallel Processing) and #8 (Model Optimization)

## Suggested Implementation Phases

To maximize parallel development while respecting dependencies:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Start #1: Parallel Processing Architecture
- Start #3: Improved Diff Visualization
- Start #5: Claude Code Proof of Concept
- Start #7: Feature Flag System (quick win)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 2-3)
- Continue #1, #3, #5
- Start #2: Progress Tracking System
- Start #6: Enhanced Evaluator-Optimizer
- Start #8: Model Optimization
- Start #9: Caching and Optimization

### Phase 3: Refinement (Weeks 3-4)
- Complete all in-progress issues
- Start #4: Interactive Resume Review (after #3 is complete)
- Start #10: Security and Compliance
- Start #11: Frontend Refinements

## Team Allocation

Optimal allocation for a team of 4-5 developers:

- **Developer 1** (Frontend): #3 → #4 → #11
- **Developer 2** (Backend/Performance): #1 → #9
- **Developer 3** (Backend/AI): #6 → #8
- **Developer 4** (Full-stack): #2 → #7 → #10
- **Developer 5** (AI/Infrastructure): #5

This allocation maximizes parallel development while respecting dependencies and developer specialties.
