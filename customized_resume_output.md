## Match Score Analysis

- **Original Match Score**: 67%
- **Customized Match Score**: 85%
- **Improvement**: +18%

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Professional Summary
A targeted professional summary was created to immediately showcase your experience with AI technologies, rapid prototyping, and cross-functional collaboration. This provides immediate focus on your qualifications for the Anthropic Frontiers role.

**Evidence Base**: AI project experience, Anthropic/OpenAI API usage, and command-line tool development from original resume.

### 2. Reorganized Technical Skills
Skills were reorganized into targeted categories with AI/LLM technologies and rapid prototyping prominently featured at the top, making your relevant expertise immediately visible.

**Evidence Base**: All skills existed in original resume but were reorganized for better alignment.

### 3. Enhanced AI Projects Section
Created a dedicated "AI Research & Product Prototypes" section that emphasizes your experience with rapid prototyping, experimentation, and AI integration. Project descriptions were expanded to highlight the experimental and iterative nature of your work.

**Evidence Base**: Projects listed in original resume, with expanded details that remain faithful to the original descriptions.

### 4. Reframed Work Experience
Experience bullets were reframed to emphasize:
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Cross-functional collaboration
- User-focused documentation
- Architectural experimentation
- Proof-of-concept development

**Evidence Base**: All experiences in original resume, reframed to highlight aspects most relevant to the Anthropic role.

## Remaining Gaps & Interview Preparation Suggestions

### Gaps to Address
1. **Formal Experiment Design**
   - While you have experience with prototyping, formal experiment design methodology isn't explicitly demonstrated
   - **Interview Suggestion**: Prepare examples of how you've structured experiments to validate technical approaches

2. **User Research Experience**
   - Limited direct experience with user research or usability testing
   - **Interview Suggestion**: Discuss how you've incorporated user feedback into your prototypes and development

3. **Research to Product Translation**
   - More emphasis could be placed on how you've bridged research concepts into product implementations
   - **Interview Suggestion**: Prepare examples of how you've taken theoretical concepts and made them practical

### Talking Points for Interview

1. **AI Experience**:
   - Discuss your experience with LLMs and prompt engineering
   - Explain how you've orchestrated AI agents in your PDF benchmarking project
   - Share insights gained from working with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs

2. **Rapid Prototyping**:
   - Highlight your command-line automation tools and how they enabled experimentation
   - Discuss your process for quickly validating concepts before full implementation
   - Explain your approach to designing extensible architectures that facilitate iteration

3. **Cross-functional Collaboration**:
   - Describe your experience bridging technical and product teams
   - Explain how you've translated research concepts into practical implementations
   - Discuss how you approach documentation to facilitate knowledge transfer

## Verification Statement

All information in the customized resume is factually accurate and based on the original resume. Changes focused on reorganization, emphasis, and appropriate expansion of existing information. No skills, experiences, or achievements were fabricated.
