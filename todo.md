2. **#107 (1.2)**: Basic Test Data Models - After #106
3. **#109 (2.1)**: Basic Evaluator Infrastructure - After #106, #107

### Parallel Work Groups

#### Group A: Test Data Creation (Can work in parallel after #107)
- **#108 (1.3)**: Sample Test Dataset Creation - After #107 (Independent work)

### Optimized Work Schedule

#### Week 1 (Sequential Foundation)
**Day 1**: #106 (Project Structure) - MUST complete first
**Day 2**: #107 (Test Data Models) - Depends on #106
**Day 3**: Start #109 (Evaluator Infrastructure) - Depends on #106, #107

#### Week 2 (Parallel Development Begins)
**Day 4-5**: Complete #109 (Evaluator Infrastructure)
**Day 5** (parallel): Start #108 (Test Dataset Creation) - Can work simultaneously

#### Week 3-4 (Maximum Parallelization)
**Parallel Team A**: #110 (Job Parsing Evaluator) - 2 days
**Parallel Team B**: #111 (Match Score Evaluator) - 2 days  
**Parallel Team C**: #112 (Truthfulness Evaluator) - 3 days
**Parallel Team D**: #113 (Content Quality Evaluator) - 2 days
**Parallel Team E**: #114 (Relevance Impact Evaluator) - 2 days

*Note: Teams can work simultaneously since all evaluators only depend on #109 (infrastructure)*

#### Week 5 (Integration Phase)
**Day 1-2**: #115 (Pipeline Integration) - After all evaluators complete
**Day 3-4**: #116 (Test Suite) - After pipeline integration

#### Week 6 (Optimization Loop)
**Day 1**: #117 (Baseline Analysis)

### Parallelization Benefits
- **Original Timeline**: 20+ days sequential
- **Optimized Timeline**: 10-12 days with parallel work (reduced due to LLMJudge)
- **Maximum Team Size**: 5 developers can work simultaneously on evaluators
- **Critical Path**: #106 → #107 → #109 → #115 → #116 → #117 → #118 → #119
- **Time Savings**: LLMJudge reduces evaluator implementation time by ~25-40%

### Team Assignment Strategy
If multiple developers available:
- **Lead Developer**: #106, #107, #109 (foundation) then #115, #116 (integration)
- **Evaluator Team 1**: #110 (Job Parsing) + #112 (Truthfulness) 
- **Evaluator Team 2**: #111 (Match Score) + #113 (Content Quality)
- **Evaluator Team 3**: #114 (Relevance Impact) + #108 (Test Dataset)
- **QA/Testing**: Focus on #116 (Test Suite) preparation during evaluator development

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. **#106**: Project Structure and Dependencies Setup (CRITICAL PATH - Day 1)
2. **#107**: Basic Test Data Models (CRITICAL PATH - Day 2)  
3. **#109**: Basic Evaluator Infrastructure (CRITICAL PATH - Days 3-5)
