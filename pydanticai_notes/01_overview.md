# PydanticAI Overview

PydanticAI is a powerful Python agent framework designed to build production-grade generative AI applications using structured data. It combines the strengths of Pydantic's data validation with flexible AI model integration.

## Core Concepts

PydanticAI works through these key components:

1. **Agent**: A wrapper around AI models that generates structured, validated responses
2. **Pydantic Models**: Define schema and validation rules for generated data
3. **System Prompts**: Instructions that guide the AI model's behavior
4. **Tools**: Functions the agent can call during execution
5. **Structured Output**: Ensures responses conform to expected types and formats
6. **Dependency Injection**: Enables flexible agent configuration

## Key Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Get AI outputs as validated Python types
2. **Structure Control**: Define exactly what format you need
3. **Model Agnostic**: Works with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
4. **Production Ready**: Built for reliability in production environments
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Customize behavior with system prompts and tools

## Basic Usage Example

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List

# Define a Pydantic model for the structure we want
class MovieRecommendation(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="The title of the movie")
    year: int = Field(description="The year the movie was released")
    genres: List[str] = Field(description="List of genres for the movie")
    reason: str = Field(description="Why this movie matches the request")

# Create an agent with our model as the output type
agent = Agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    output_type=MovieRecommendation
)

# Run the agent with a prompt
result = await agent.run("Recommend a sci-fi movie from the 1980s")

# result is a MovieRecommendation object
print(f"Title: {result.title}")
print(f"Year: {result.year}")
print(f"Genres: {', '.join(result.genres)}")
print(f"Reason: {result.reason}")
```

## Application to Resume Customization

For the Resume Customization Service, PydanticAI provides several advantages:

1. **Structured Processing**: Define explicit models for each stage of resume customization
2. **Validation**: Ensure AI outputs match expected formats
3. **Workflow Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
4. **Type Safety**: Integrate AI seamlessly with the rest of the Python codebase
5. **Reliability**: Improve error handling and reduce failure cases
