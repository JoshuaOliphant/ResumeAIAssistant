# PydanticAI Implementation for Resume Customization

This document describes the implementation of the PydanticAI-based resume customization service and how to test it.

## Overview

The PydanticAI integration follows a four-stage workflow for resume customization:

1. **Evaluation** - Analyze resume against job description
2. **Planning** - Create a customization plan
3. **Implementation** - Apply the plan to the resume
4. **Verification** - Verify the customized resume

Each stage uses the Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet model through PydanticAI's structured output generation capabilities. The service also implements real-time progress tracking via WebSockets to provide users with feedback during the customization process.

## Implementation Details

Key files and components:

- `/app/services/pydanticai_optimizer.py` - Core implementation of the PydanticAI-based resume customization service
- `/app/schemas/pydanticai_models.py` - Schema models for structured output generation
- `/app/services/websocket_manager.py` - WebSocket manager for progress reporting
- `/app/services/progress_tracker.py` - Progress tracking for the customization process
- `/app/api/endpoints/customize.py` - API endpoint for resume customization
- `/nextjs-frontend/components/customize-resume.tsx` - Frontend component for resume customization

## Testing the Implementation

### Backend Testing

1. Set up the development environment:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

2. Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001 --reload
```

3. Run the backend tests to verify the implementation:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_resume_customizer_endpoint.py
```

### Frontend Testing

1. Set up the Next.js development environment:

```bash
cd nextjs-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open the application in a browser (http://localhost:3000).

3. Log in to the application and navigate to the customization flow:
   - Upload or create a resume
   - Create or import a job description
   - Start the customization process

4. Monitor the customization progress in the UI and check the browser console for WebSocket messages.

5. Examine the server logs to verify that the PydanticAI service is being called correctly.

## WebSocket Progress Reporting

The implementation includes real-time progress reporting via WebSockets. The frontend connects to the WebSocket endpoint `/ws/customize/{customization_id}` and receives progress updates as the customization process progresses through its stages.

Progress updates include:
- Current stage (evaluation, planning, implementation, verification)
- Stage progress percentage
- Overall progress percentage
- Status message

## Debugging

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the server logs for error messages.
2. Verify that the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly.
3. Check the browser console for WebSocket connection issues.
4. Verify that the frontend is correctly passing the customization_id to the WebSocket connection.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:

1. Implement fallback models in case the primary Claude model fails
2. Add more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Implement caching for common job descriptions to improve performance
4. Add support for multiple customization strength levels (conservative, balanced, extensive)
5. Enhance the truthfulness verification with more sophisticated techniques
