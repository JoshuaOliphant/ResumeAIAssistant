# ResumeAIAssistant Project Plan

## Current Project Status

Based on the project documentation, codebase review, and application screenshots, the ResumeAIAssistant is a sophisticated application with several key components:

1. **PydanticAI Architecture**: A model-agnostic AI system using the evaluator-optimizer pattern for analyzing resumes, generating optimization plans, and customizing resumes for specific job descriptions.

2. **Multi-Model Support**: Integration with multiple AI providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI) with intelligent model selection and dynamic thinking budget allocation.

3. **Next.js Frontend**: Modern interface with shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, including resume management, ATS analysis, and customization workflows.

4. **Existing Features**: Resume upload/management, job description retrieval, user authentication, ATS analysis, resume customization, and result downloads in various formats.

## Key Achievements So Far

1. ✅ Gemini API integration in PydanticAI (TASK-1)
2. ✅ Dynamic thinking budget implementation (TASK-2) 
3. ✅ Task-based model selection utility (TASK-3)
4. ✅ Functional Next.js frontend with basic UI components
5. ✅ Working resume customization pipeline
6. ✅ ATS analysis and scoring system

## Core Issues to Address

1. **Performance**: Resume customization process is slow, requiring improved speed and better progress indication
2. **User Experience**: Diff view UI needs improvement for better visualization of changes
3. **Architecture**: Potential for parallelization to improve speed and reduce costs
4. **Focus**: Need to temporarily remove or disable non-core features (like cover letter generation)

## Implementation Considerations

### Approach to Parallelization

1. **Analysis Phase Parallelization**:
   - Break resume into logical sections (summary, experience, education, skills)
   - Process each section with appropriate specialized models in parallel
   - Use cheaper models for simpler analyses
   - Combine results into unified analysis

2. **Implementation Phase Parallelization**:
   - Process different sections in parallel based on analysis results
   - Implement progressive loading of completed sections
   - Use lightweight models for simpler modifications
   - Sequential final pass for consistency and coherence

### Cover Letter Handling

1. **Short-term**: Move behind feature flag and disable in production to focus on core resume functionality
2. **If reactivated**: Ensure separate processing queue that doesn't impact resume customization

### Claude Code Integration Approach

1. **Security First**: Implement proper isolation via Docker container
2. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Create specialized versions of CLAUDE.md for different tasks
   - Build wrapper API that handles input/output processing
   - Implement timeout and error handling
   - Create fallback to existing services when necessary

3. **Progressive Implementation**:
   - Start with isolated components that don't affect core functionality
   - Benchmark against existing implementation
   - Gradually expand to more critical components as confidence increases
