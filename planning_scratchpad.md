# ResumeAIAssistant Project Plan

## Current Project Status

Based on the project documentation, codebase review, and application screenshots, the ResumeAIAssistant is a sophisticated application with several key components:

1. **PydanticAI Architecture**: A model-agnostic AI system using the evaluator-optimizer pattern for analyzing resumes, generating optimization plans, and customizing resumes for specific job descriptions.

2. **Multi-Model Support**: Integration with multiple AI providers (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI) with intelligent model selection and dynamic thinking budget allocation.

3. **Next.js Frontend**: Modern interface with shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS, including resume management, ATS analysis, and customization workflows.

4. **Existing Features**: Resume upload/management, job description retrieval, user authentication, ATS analysis, resume customization, and result downloads in various formats.

## Key Achievements So Far

1. ✅ Gemini API integration in PydanticAI (TASK-1)
2. ✅ Dynamic thinking budget implementation (TASK-2) 
3. ✅ Task-based model selection utility (TASK-3)
4. ✅ Functional Next.js frontend with basic UI components
5. ✅ Working resume customization pipeline
6. ✅ ATS analysis and scoring system

## Core Issues to Address

1. **Performance**: Resume customization process is slow, requiring improved speed and better progress indication
2. **User Experience**: Diff view UI needs improvement for better visualization of changes
3. **Architecture**: Potential for parallelization to improve speed and reduce costs
4. **Focus**: Need to temporarily remove or disable non-core features (like cover letter generation)
