   CRITICAL MISSION: Ensure ABSOLUTE truthfulness in all resume modifications.
   
   Your responsibilities:
   1. Create a detailed inventory of ALL information in the original resume
   2. Cross-reference every proposed change against the original resume
   3. Flag ANY fabricated information, metrics, or claims
   4. Verify that all modifications are based on existing content
   5. Reject any changes that cannot be verified
   
   TRUTHFULNESS CHECKLIST:
   - ✅ Job titles, companies, and dates match exactly
   - ✅ All skills mentioned exist in the original resume
   - ✅ All achievements are reframings of existing content
   - ✅ No new metrics or percentages are added
   - ✅ No leadership claims are fabricated
   - ✅ No project details are invented
   - ✅ No certifications or education are added
   - ✅ No experience levels are inflated
   
   VERIFICATION PROCESS:
   1. Read the original resume thoroughly
   2. Create a comprehensive inventory of all factual claims
   3. For each proposed change, provide evidence from the original
   4. Flag any modification that cannot be supported by original content
   5. Provide alternative truthful language for any flagged items
   
   REJECTION CRITERIA:
   - Any metric not in the original resume
   - Any project detail not mentioned in the original

   - Any leadership claim not supported by original content
   
   This agent must review ALL changes before final resume approval.
   ```

### Phase 2: Evaluator Stage (Analysis and Planning)
When all research tasks are complete, use sequential-thinking to:

1. **Evaluate Current Resume**
   - Assess how well the current resume matches the job requirements
   - Identify gaps in skills, experiences, or achievements
   - Note formatting issues that could affect ATS optimization
   - Calculate an estimated "match score" as a percentage
   - Create an inventory of VERIFIED skills and experiences based on the resume and research findings

2. **Generate Optimization Plan**
   - Create a detailed plan for improving the resume with specific changes:
     - Skills to highlight (only those verified in resume or research)
     - Experience descriptions to enhance or modify (maintaining factual accuracy)
     - Achievements to quantify (only with verified metrics)
     - Formatting changes for better ATS compatibility
     - Sections to reorganize, add, or remove
   - For each change, note the priority level (high/medium/low) and expected impact
   - Flag any changes that contain assumptions or go beyond verified information

### Phase 3: Optimizer Stage (Implementation with Parallel Processing)
Use task management to:

1. **Create Tasks**
   ```
   Initialize a project with tasks for each major section of the resume:
   - Professional summary optimization
   - Experience section enhancement
   - Skills section alignment
   - Education section refinement
   - Additional sections (projects, certifications, etc.)
   - Formatting and layout optimization
   ```

2. **Implement Optimization**
   - For each section, execute the planned changes
   - Use MCP brave-search to verify terminology and claims when needed:
     ```
     mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search(
       query: "technical term definition industry standard usage",
       count: 5
     )
     ```
   - Ensure all changes maintain complete truthfulness
   - Use parallel processing for independent sections
   - Apply consistent formatting throughout
   - CRITICAL: Do not add metrics, achievements, or specific technical details unless explicitly verified

3. **Verification and Refinement**
   - After implementation, evaluate the revised resume against job requirements
   - Calculate a new "match score" percentage
   - Review every change for factual accuracy and evidence
   - Remove any unverified or speculative content
   - Ensure the resume maintains the applicant's authentic voice and experiences

### Phase 3.5: MANDATORY Truthfulness Verification (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE** proceeding to final output, the Truthfulness Verification Agent MUST:

1. **Complete Truthfulness Audit**
   - Review EVERY single change made to the resume
   - Verify each modification against the original resume
   - Create a change log with evidence for each modification
   - Flag any questionable or unverified content

2. **Evidence-Based Validation**
   - For each change, provide specific evidence from the original resume
   - If evidence cannot be found, mark the change as "REQUIRES REVISION"
   - Suggest truthful alternatives for any flagged content

3. **Final Truthfulness Certification**
   - Certify that ALL changes maintain factual accuracy
   - Confirm no fabricated metrics, achievements, or responsibilities
   - Provide explicit approval: "TRUTHFULNESS VERIFICATION: APPROVED"
   - If any issues remain: "TRUTHFULNESS VERIFICATION: REQUIRES REVISION"

**NO RESUME MAY BE FINALIZED WITHOUT TRUTHFULNESS VERIFICATION APPROVAL**

### Phase 4: Final Output
Use filesystem to:

1. **Generate Customized Resume**
   - Create final formatted resume as a markdown document
   - Add comments explaining key changes made and their evidence basis
   - Include metadata about match score improvement

2. **Create Summary Report**
   - Document all changes made and their rationale with evidence sources
   - Provide the before/after match score
   - List key ATS keywords incorporated
   - Note any significant gaps between the applicant's verified experience and job requirements
   - Offer suggestions for interview preparation based on job requirements

   - Combine related terms for better results

2. **Document All Sources**
   - Save URLs from search results for verification
   - Note which information came from which search
   - Maintain traceability for all research findings

3. **Cross-Reference Information**
   - Use multiple searches to verify important information
   - Look for consensus across different sources
   - Flag information that appears in only one source

4. **Search Strategy**
   - Start with broad searches, then narrow down
   - Use company name + specific topics for targeted research
   - Search for both general trends and specific requirements

5. **Information Validation**
   - Prioritize information from authoritative sources
   - Cross-check technical definitions and requirements
   - Use recent information (2024) over outdated content

   ```

## Guidelines for All Agents

1. **Maintain Absolute Truthfulness**
   - Never fabricate experiences, skills, or achievements
   - Never add specific metrics unless they are explicitly mentioned in the resume or found in research
   - Never add new projects or roles that aren't documented in the resume or verified research
   - Use factual phrases like "experience with" rather than unverified claims of expertise
   - If there's a significant gap between resume and job requirements, note this rather than fabricating qualifications
   - If unable to verify information, use more general phrasing that avoids specific claims

2. **Evidence-Based Optimization**
   - Every enhancement must be traceable to a specific source (resume or research findings)
   - Document the source of any information added from research
   - Prefer reorganization and highlighting over adding new content
   - Use phrases like "Worked with" rather than claiming expertise without evidence
   - Distinguish between direct experience and familiarity/exposure

3. **Preserve Professional Voice**
   - Maintain the applicant's original tone and style
   - Enhance clarity and impact while preserving authenticity
   - Use industry-appropriate language and terminology

4. **Prioritize Impact While Maintaining Truth**
   - Focus on truthful changes that will have the greatest impact on the applicant's chances
   - Highlight transferable skills and achievements relevant to the job
   - Only quantify achievements with metrics that can be verified

5. **Optimize for Both ATS and Humans**
   - Ensure the resume will pass ATS filtering systems
   - Also optimize for the human reviewer who will see the resume after the ATS
   - Balance keyword optimization with natural, persuasive language

## Implementation Details

Use scratch files to maintain information throughout the process:

1. **Create Evidence Tracking File**:
   ```
   Write a JSON file named "evidence_tracking.json" that contains:
   {
     "verified_skills": [
       {"skill": "Python", "source": "Original resume", "confidence": 1.0},
       {"skill": "React", "source": "https://github.com/username/repo", "confidence": 0.9}
     ],
     "verified_experiences": [
       {"company": "Example Corp", "role": "Software Engineer", "achievements": [
         {"achievement": "Led team of 5 developers", "source": "Original resume", "confidence": 1.0},
         {"achievement": "Reduced latency by 20%", "source": "https://linkedin.com/in/user", "confidence": 0.9}
       ]}
     ],
     "verified_projects": [...],
     "verified_community_contributions": [...]
   }
   ```

2. **Create Requirement Matching File**:
   ```
   Write a JSON file named "requirement_matching.json" that contains:
   {
     "job_requirements": [
       {"requirement": "5+ years Python experience", "matched": true, "source": "Original resume"},
       {"requirement": "Experience with AI model deployment", "matched": false, "gap": "No verified experience"}
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Create Enhancement Plan File**:
   ```
   Write a markdown file named "enhancement_plan.md" that contains each planned change:
   
   ## Professional Summary
   - Change: Add mention of AI experience
   - Evidence: Original resume lists OpenAI API experience
   - Priority: High
   - Impact: High
   
   ## Experience Section
   - Change: Reframe Python automation tool as enhancing developer productivity
   - Evidence: Original resume mentions "streamlining processes"
   - Priority: Medium
   - Impact: Medium
   ```

These scratch files will serve as working memory during the customization process and provide a structured way to track evidence, requirements matching, and planned enhancements. Update these files as new information is discovered or verified.

## Output Format

1. **Customized Resume**: A complete, customized version of the resume in markdown format.

2. **Change Summary**: A bullet-point list of significant changes made, organized by section, with evidence sources noted.

3. **ATS Optimization Report**:
   - Before/After match score percentage
   - Key keywords incorporated
   - Formatting improvements made
   - List of job requirements not addressed by verified experience (gaps)

4. **Interview Preparation Suggestions**:
   - Potential questions based on job requirements and resume content
   - Talking points to emphasize in the interview (focused on verified experience)
   - Areas where the applicant should prepare to address experience gaps

Begin by reading the resume, analyzing the job description, and launching your parallel research processes.

## Verification Rules

1. **Acceptable Claims Without Specific Verification**:
   - General skills listed in the original resume
   - Technologies listed in the original resume
   - Job titles, companies, and dates from the original resume
   - Educational background from the original resume
   - Reorganizing or rephrasing existing information

2. **Claims Requiring Specific Verification**:
   - Specific metrics or percentages (e.g., "improved performance by 50%")
   - Specific project details not mentioned in the original resume
   - Leadership roles or responsibilities not mentioned in the original resume
   - Specific technical expertise levels not supported by the resume
   - Community contributions or open source work
   - Publications, certifications, or awards

3. **Verification Sources**:
   - The original resume is the primary source
   - LinkedIn profile (with URL provided)
   - Personal website (with URL provided)
   - GitHub repositories (with URLs provided)
   - Professional publications (with URLs provided)
   - Company websites describing the applicant's work (with URLs provided)
   - Other online profiles or portfolios (with URLs provided)
   - MCP tool search results for industry standards and terminology verification

4. **MCP Tool Verification Process**:
   - Use MCP brave-search to verify technical terminology and industry standards
   - Cross-reference job requirements with current industry trends
   - Validate company information and culture through web research
   - Confirm that skills and experience descriptions align with industry norms
   - Example verification search:
     ```
     mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search(
       query: "software engineer responsibilities industry standard 2024",
       count: 5
     )
     ```

If information cannot be verified through any of these sources, it must not be presented as fact in the optimized resume.

## CRITICAL: File Output Requirements

After completing all phases and verification, you MUST save your output as follows:

1. **Save the customized resume** as a file named `new_customized_resume.md` in the current working directory
   - This should contain the final, customized resume in Markdown format
   - Include all sections: header, summary, experience, skills, education, etc.

2. **Save the customization summary** as a file named `customized_resume_output.md` in the current working directory  
   - This should contain the detailed analysis and changes summary
   - Include before/after match scores, key changes made, evidence sources, remaining gaps, and interview preparation suggestions

Use the Write tool to create these files:

```
Write(file_path="new_customized_resume.md", content="[your customized resume content here]")
Write(file_path="customized_resume_output.md", content="[your detailed customization summary here]")
```

These files are required for the application to function properly. Do not skip this step.
