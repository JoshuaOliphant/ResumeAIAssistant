## Current Architecture Analysis

The current architecture uses Claude for several AI-driven features:

1. **Resume Customization** (`customize_resume`): Tailors a resume to match a job description with different customization strengths.
2. **Resume-Job Match Evaluation** (`evaluate_resume_job_match`): Analyzes how well a resume matches a job description.
3. **Optimization Plan Generation** (`generate_optimization_plan`): Creates a detailed plan for improving a resume.
4. **Cover Letter Generation** (`generate_cover_letter`): Creates a personalized cover letter.

The application uses an "evaluator-optimizer" pattern where:
- The "evaluator" analyzes the resume-job match and provides structured feedback
- The "optimizer" then creates a detailed plan based on the evaluation
- This is a multi-step AI workflow with structured outputs

Key components include:
- `claude_service.py`: Core Claude API integration
- `prompts.py`: Detailed system prompts for different tasks
- `customization_service.py`: Business logic for the evaluator-optimizer pattern
- `ats.py` & `customize.py`: API endpoints

     client = OpenAI()
     
     response = client.responses.create(
         model="gpt-4o",
         messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
     )
     ```

3. **Agents SDK**:
   - Lightweight, open-source framework for building agentic applications
   - Enables multi-agent workflows with custom orchestration
   - Can be integrated with the Responses API or Chat Completions API
   - Key components:
     - `Agent`: LLMs configured with instructions, tools, and handoffs
     - `Handoffs`: Tools for transferring control between agents
     - `Tools`: Functional capabilities that agents can use
     - `Runner`: Executes agent workflows
   - Built-in tracing for monitoring and debugging
   - Recommended implementation uses `OpenAIResponsesModel` which connects to the Responses API
   - Basic usage:
     ```python
     from agents import Agent, Runner
     import asyncio
     
     agent = Agent(
         name="Assistant",
         instructions="You are a helpful assistant"
     )
     
     async def main():
         result = await Runner.run(agent, "Write a resume summary for a software engineer.")
         print(result.final_output)
     
     asyncio.run(main())
     ```

4. **Vector Stores and RAG**:
   - Used for retrieval-augmented generation
   - Can be integrated with Responses API and Agents SDK
   - Useful for storing and retrieving industry-specific resume templates and job descriptions
   - Enables more effective customization based on industry standards

## Evaluator-Optimizer Implementation with Agents SDK

The evaluator-optimizer pattern is a powerful workflow where one agent generates content and another agent evaluates it, providing feedback for improvement in an iterative loop. This pattern is well-suited for the resume customization task, where we want to both evaluate the resume-job match and optimize the resume based on that evaluation.

### How the Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern Works

1. **Generator Agent**: Creates or modifies content (in our case, resume customizations)
2. **Evaluator Agent**: Assesses the content against specific criteria and provides feedback
3. **Iteration Loop**: The feedback is fed back to the Generator to improve the content
4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the Evaluator determines the content meets requirements

### Implementation with OpenAI Agents SDK

Here's how to implement the evaluator-optimizer pattern for ResumeAIAssistant using the OpenAI Agents SDK:

#### 1. Define Specialized Agents

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, OpenAIResponsesModel

    score: int = Field(..., description="Overall match score from 0-100")
    keyword_matches: List[str] = Field(..., description="Keywords found in both resume and job description")
    missing_keywords: List[str] = Field(..., description="Important keywords from job description missing in resume")
    suggestions: List[str] = Field(..., description="Specific suggestions for improvement")
    passes_evaluation: bool = Field(..., description="Whether the resume passes minimum requirements")

# Create Evaluator Agent
evaluator_agent = Agent(
    name="Resume Evaluator",
    instructions="""

    4. Whether the resume passes minimum requirements
    
    Be thorough in your analysis and provide actionable feedback.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Structured Output**: Each agent produces structured data using Pydantic models
2. **Iterative Improvement**: The feedback loop ensures continuous improvement
3. **Configurable Settings**: Customization level and iteration count can be adjusted
4. **Custom Tools**: Enhanced functionality through specialized tools like ATS simulation
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between evaluation and optimization
6. **Detailed Feedback**: Comprehensive evaluation at each step
7. **Traceable Process**: Complete history of iterations for transparency

By implementing the evaluator-optimizer pattern using OpenAI's Agents SDK, we can create a more robust and effective resume customization system that provides detailed feedback and iteratively improves the resume until it meets the desired criteria.

   - Maintain the existing API contracts and input/output formats
   - Add specific error handling for agent errors
   - Ensure all existing functionality is preserved
   - Add telemetry to compare performance with Claude

3. Update Cover Letter Endpoints (app/api/endpoints/cover_letter.py):
   - Replace Claude service calls with the equivalent Agent SDK calls
   - Preserve the same interface for backward compatibility
   - Add proper error handling for agent-specific errors
   - Update logging to include agent-specific information

4. Testing & Validation:
   - Add validation checks to ensure outputs match expected formats
   - Include fallback mechanisms for handling agent errors
   - Update error messages to be specific to the Agents SDK

Follow the project's existing API architecture and error handling patterns.
