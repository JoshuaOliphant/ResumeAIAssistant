# Implement Enhanced Progress Tracking System

## Summary
- Added WebSocket-based real-time progress updates for long-running operations
- Implemented granular process tracking with detailed stage information
- Created accurate time estimation based on task complexity calculation
- Added notification system for process completion
- Designed visual progress indicator with detailed stage information

## Core Features
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket communication for live progress tracking
- **Granular Stages**: Detailed tracking across initialization, analysis, planning, implementation, and finalization
- **Complexity-based Estimation**: Smart time estimation based on section complexity
- **Browser Notifications**: System notifications when operations complete
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic WebSocket reconnection if connection drops
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Client-side simulation when WebSocket isn't available

## Technical Changes
- Added new `progress.py` endpoint for WebSocket connections:
  - Implemented `ProgressConnectionManager` for handling connections
  - Created pub/sub model for distributing updates to subscribed clients
  - Added JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
  - Implemented REST API endpoints for fallback

- Enhanced the `parallel_processor.py`:
  - Added `ProgressTracker` class for monitoring operations
  - Updated `ParallelTaskScheduler` to report progress
  - Implemented task complexity calculation

- Added frontend components:
  - Created `progress-tracker.tsx` component for WebSocket integration
  - Built `notification-badge.tsx` for system-wide notifications
  - Updated existing components to use real-time progress

## Testing
- Added comprehensive tests for WebSocket implementation
- Created tests for progress tracking integration
- Added frontend component tests

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload
   ```
2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd nextjs-frontend && npm run dev
   ```
3. Start a resume customization operation and observe real-time updates
4. Verify browser notifications appear when operations complete

## Screenshots
The enhanced progress tracking includes:
- Real-time progress bar with current stage indicator
- Time estimation based on task complexity
- Notification badge in application header
- Browser notifications for completed operations
