## Implementation Details

### Core Features
- **Multiple View Options**: Side-by-side, inline, original, and customized views

- Created an example script to easily demonstrate the visualization

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the example script to generate a demo diff:
   ```bash
   python example_diff.py
   ```
2. Open the generated HTML file in your browser:
   ```bash
   open demo_output/diff_output.html
   ```
3. Try the various diff view options and section navigation
