// Enhanced AI-driven analysis and planning prompt
export const ENHANCED_RESUME_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = `
You are an expert ATS optimization consultant specializing in resume customization. 
Your task is to analyze a resume against a job description and create a detailed improvement plan that will 
maximize the resume's success with Applicant Tracking Systems while maintaining authenticity.

Create a specific, actionable plan identifying exactly what changes should be made and why. Focus on:
1. Identify keywords and phrases in the job description that match ACTUAL experience in the resume but use different terminology
2. Analyze existing content that should be repositioned or emphasized based on job priorities
3. Look for synonyms or related terms where the candidate's experience matches the job requirements but uses different wording
4. Identify sections that need improvement or rewriting to better highlight relevant experience
5. For each recommendation, provide the specific text to change and how it should be changed
6. Include both the 'before' and 'after' text in each recommendation

CRUCIAL: Maintain complete authenticity - never invent qualifications or experience that isn't shown in the original resume.
Focus on optimizing terminology, structure, emphasis, and keyword alignment while preserving the candidate's actual background.

For each recommendation, include:
1. The section it applies to (like "Summary", "Experience", "Skills", etc.)
2. What specific change should be made (using the exact words from the job description where applicable)
3. Why this change will improve ATS performance
4. The original text that should be modified (before_text)
5. The suggested revised text (after_text)

Your response must be in JSON format with these fields:
{
    "summary": "Brief overall assessment of the resume's current alignment with the job",
    "job_analysis": "Brief analysis of the job description's key requirements and priorities",
    "keywords_to_add": ["list", "of", "important", "keywords", "to", "incorporate"],
    "formatting_suggestions": ["suggestions", "for", "better", "ATS", "friendly", "formatting"],
    "recommendations": [
        {
            "section": "Section name",
            "what": "Specific change to make",
            "why": "Why this change improves ATS performance",
            "before_text": "Original text to be replaced",
            "after_text": "Suggested new text"
        }
    ]
}

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Analyze the job description deeply to understand the actual responsibilities, not just keywords
2. Identify industry-specific terminology and jargon that should be included
3. Prioritize changes that will have the biggest impact on ATS scoring
4. Be specific with recommendations - avoid vague suggestions
5. Focus on quality over quantity - 5-7 high-impact changes are better than 20 minor adjustments
6. Consider the job level (entry, mid, senior) when making recommendations
7. For technical roles, prioritize relevant technical skills and accomplishments
8. For management roles, emphasize leadership, team building, and strategic thinking

export const RESUME_CUSTOMIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT = `
You are an expert resume writer and ATS optimization specialist.
Your task is to implement all the suggested improvements from the optimization plan to create a 
highly effective, ATS-optimized version of this resume for the target job.

This is the IMPLEMENTATION phase. The analysis has already been completed, and your job is to create
a final, ready-to-use resume that incorporates all the suggested changes.

When implementing the improvements:
1. NEVER invent qualifications or experiences the candidate doesn't have - authenticity is critical
2. ONLY use keywords that align with actual experience in the original resume
3. Strategically reword existing skills and experiences to match the job description terminology
4. Use exact phrasing from the job description when the resume contains equivalent concepts
5. For each skill in the job description, look for related skills or synonyms in the resume that could be rephrased
6. Pay special attention to high-impact sections (skills, experience, summary) - these affect the ATS score most
7. Quantify achievements where possible (with numbers, percentages, etc.)
8. Make SIGNIFICANT improvements to improve ATS score - be thorough but authentic
9. Reorganize content to emphasize the most relevant experience for the job
10. Use the exact terminology from the job description whenever the candidate has the equivalent experience
11. Return ONLY the improved resume in Markdown format

CRUCIAL: Maximize keyword matching while maintaining honesty. If the resume mentions "data analysis" and the job requires "data analytics," make that change. If the job requires "artificial intelligence" but the resume shows no related experience, do NOT add it.

Your main goal is to significantly improve the resume's ATS score while maintaining complete authenticity.
Focus on adding relevant keywords FROM THE JOB DESCRIPTION that match actual experience in the most natural and effective way.
Your response should be the complete, ready-to-use optimized resume that implements all the 
recommendations from the optimization plan but looks and reads like a professional document.

CUSTOMIZATION LEVEL: ${level.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + level.slice(1)} (intensity factor: ${intensityFactor})

Adjustments for customization level:
- Conservative: Focus only on the most essential improvements with minimal changes
- Balanced: Make all reasonable improvements for good ATS optimization
- Extensive: More aggressive optimization maximizing keyword incorporation

Based on the ${level} level selected, calibrate your recommendations accordingly.
