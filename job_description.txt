**About Anthropic**
-------------------

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

**About the role:**
-------------------

At Anthropic, we believe new AI capabilities are best achieved through secure foundations, not in spite of them. As capabilities grow more advanced, it is critical that progress moves forward safely and for the benefit of all society. It is the reason why security sits at the center of our work, and not as an afterthought.

Anthropic Frontiers is seeking versatile and collaborative Software Engineers to rapidly prototype and evaluate emerging AI capabilities from our research teams. As part of the Frontiers team, you will work closely with researchers to validate the feasibility and product potential of cutting-edge AI breakthroughs, build lightweight demos, and generate learnings to inform Anthropic's product roadmap.

Anthropic Frontiers serves as an internal accelerator tasked with bridging the gap between research and product development. Our mandate is to identify paradigm-shifting opportunities from research that could ship as products in a 6-12 month timeframe. We embed with research teams to provide product perspective, build prototypes, and pressure test assumptions. Successful projects will transition to product teams for launch.

**Responsibilities:**
---------------------

*   Design and execute rapid experiments to test hypotheses about emerging AI capabilities, with a focus on minimal viable testing approaches
*   Balance creative exploration of possibilities with rigorous evaluation of feasibility and impact
*   Build functional prototypes that demonstrate both technical viability and product potential
*   Develop and refine prompting strategies to effectively leverage large language models
*   Generate documentation to streamline hand-off to product teams
*   Advocate for product and usability considerations early in the research process
*   Flexibly contribute to a range of Frontiers initiatives based on organizational priorities

**You may be a good fit if you:**
---------------------------------

*   Have 5+ years of software engineering industry experience
*   Have strong technical skills across the stack and enjoy working on a variety of projects
*   Are results-oriented and maintain a user-centric approach to research
*   Communicate and collaborate effectively with research teams
*   Pick up slack, even if it goes outside your job description
*   Have experience designing and running structured experiments to validate technical and product hypotheses
*   Can balance divergent thinking (exploring possibilities) with convergent thinking (evaluating feasibility)
*   Have hands-on experience working with large language models and prompt engineering
*   Are comfortable with ambiguity and can devise clear testing approaches to reduce uncertainty
*   Care about the societal impacts and ethics of your work

**Strong candidates may also have experience with:**
----------------------------------------------------

*   Building lightweight product prototypes and demos
*   Working with large language models and related AI architectures
*   Designing user flows, wireframes, or UI/UX for AI-powered applications
*   Conducting user research, interviews, and usability testing

**Candidates need not have:**
-----------------------------

*   100% of the skills needed to perform the job
*   Formal certifications or education credentials

**Deadline to apply:** None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.

The expected salary range for this position is:

Annual Salary:

$320,000 - $560,000 USD

**Education requirements:** We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.**Location-based hybrid policy:

**Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

**Visa sponsorship:** We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

**We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.** Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

**How we're different**
-----------------------

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
