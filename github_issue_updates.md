## Issue #109: Basic Evaluator Infrastructure

**Objective**: Implement the core evaluator framework using PydanticAI with LLMJudge as the primary evaluation mechanism.

### Background
Following the completion of test data models (#107), we need to build the core infrastructure that will power all evaluation components. This infrastructure will integrate PydanticAI's LLMJudge to enable sophisticated, LLM-based evaluation of our resume optimization methods.

### Requirements

1. **BaseEvaluator Abstract Class with LLMJudge Integration**
   - Create abstract base class that all evaluators will inherit from
   - Integrate with PydanticAI's LLMJudge for evaluation
   - Configure Sonnet as the default judge model
   - Define standard interface for evaluation methods
   - Support both sync and async evaluation patterns

2. **Judge Model Configuration**
   - Set up configuration management for judge model selection
   - Default to Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) as the judge
   - Allow environment variable override for judge model
   - Implement cost tracking for judge API calls

3. **TestRunner Implementation**
   - Load test datasets and execute evaluations
   - Support parallel evaluation execution
   - Integrate with PydanticAI's Dataset and Case structures
   - Collect and aggregate results from multiple evaluators
   - Progress tracking and estimated completion times

4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Comprehensive error handling for API failures
   - Retry logic for transient failures
   - Detailed logging of evaluation progress
   - Performance metrics collection

### Technical Specifications

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pydantic_ai import LLMJudge
from typing import Any, Dict, List

class BaseEvaluator(ABC):
    def __init__(self, judge_model: str = "sonnet"):
        self.judge = LLMJudge(model=judge_model)
        
    @abstractmethod
    def create_rubric(self) -> str:
        """Define the evaluation rubric for LLMJudge"""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    async def evaluate(self, test_case: TestCase, actual_output: Any) -> EvaluationResult:
        """Execute evaluation using LLMJudge"""
        pass
```

### Dependencies

## Issue #110: Accuracy Evaluator for Job Parsing

**Objective**: Implement evaluation for the `parse_job_requirements()` method using PydanticAI's LLMJudge with Sonnet as the judge.

### Background
The job parsing accuracy evaluator will assess how well our system extracts skills, technologies, and requirements from job descriptions. Using LLMJudge allows sophisticated evaluation of parsing quality without building complex heuristics.

### Requirements

   - Technology identification correctness
   - Requirement prioritization assessment
   - Confidence score calibration evaluation
   - Fuzzy matching for skill variations (e.g., "JS" vs "JavaScript")

3. **Evaluation Dimensions**
   - **Completeness**: Did we extract all important skills/requirements?
   - **Accuracy**: Are the extracted items actually in the job description?
   - **Relevance**: Are the most important requirements properly identified?
   - **Confidence**: Are confidence scores well-calibrated?

4. **Structured Feedback**
   - Specific examples of missed requirements
   - Identification of false positives
   - Suggestions for improvement
   - Pattern analysis across test cases

### Technical Approach

```python
class JobParsingAccuracyEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    def create_rubric(self) -> str:
        return """
        Evaluate the job parsing output against the ground truth:
        
        1. Skill Extraction (40%):
           - All required skills identified
           - No fabricated skills added
